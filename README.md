# Statistical Analysis of UCI’s Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset

1 in 8 women in the U.S. will develop symptoms of invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime [2]. A
benign tumor is non-invasive and doesn’t spread in the body, but on the other had, a malignant tumor is invasive
and hence it’s detection at early stages is critical. This project uses UCI’s Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset [1]
and analyses the features of digitised images of breast mass for malignant and benign tumors. The project aims
to understand the sample statistics and estimate the population parameters that would help researchers identify
the class of tumor from digitised images. The project includes Hypothesis tests to verify the difference in
concave points and symmetry among the 2 classes, as well as a regression analysis to find the association
between radius and concave points.
